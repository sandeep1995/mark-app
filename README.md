# mobile.dev Frontend Take-home assignment

## Assignment

Your assignment is to build a "marker" app that will be used to prepare a data set for a computer vision, where it is possible for users to mark and tag objects in an image. To make it more clear, the image below shows an example of what the marking of objects could look like:

![Objects tagged in an image](https://i.ibb.co/D1PqbMq/image.png)

## Requirements
It should be possible to

- Mark objects in the image using the mouse
- Give each object a name
- Update the name of a marked object
- Delete previously marked objects
- View all marked objects in the image
- Show all marked objects in a list view adjacent to the image
- Upon marking an object, the marked object is added to the list view

## UI / UX
This marker application is a highly interactive web application, so emphasis will be put on what it feels like to interact with it as a user as well as what it looks like design-wise.

## Stack
There are no explicit requirements in terms of what styling frameworks, build tools etc to use but since we use React / Typescript internally we recommend that you build the solution using at least these two frameworks.

## Time limit
There is no time limit associated with this solution, but we don't expect this to take more than two hours.

## Submissions
Please submit your solution as Pull Request to this repository with instructions on how to build and run it.

## Questions
If you have any questions, please reach out to to your mobile.dev contact!

Best of luck!
